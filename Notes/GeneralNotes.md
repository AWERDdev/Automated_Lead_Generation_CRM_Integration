the lead generator API is going greate so far I am trying to add all the latest and best tech to this while also taking care of customizablity for all users from the backend and frontend by using the endpoints to make it easier to customize and change and so far doing create I expect to finish this in about 2 to 3 weeks of programming time and maybe in about a month depending on how big I want it and how long it takes as I don't always get the chance to work and some times I am just too lazy but thankfuly this project is going greate and will be the best python project I make and after it I will make the SaaS version of this app and then the Private version sutaible for companies and single users this app I think is going to be very profitable I hope just because of the quality alone is just great right now I am working on testing this app and running it I think I might run into some scrapping errors maybe not like full errors that will breake the programme but maybe some mistakes or some tweakes to make the scrapping more effictive but I do wish to add an AI model to it but my LapTop and PC won't allow this due to the both of them using intergrated graphics which is sad really

quick update on my project I have now intergrated postgres and now it is the main DB and the signup routes use it I still haven't tested anything out but the logic is good now what is missing is to updated the login to use postgres and add routes to handle that then the signup will be basiclly completed I am going to work on that now it should be pretty simple and easy to do and after that the app will be pretty much done
